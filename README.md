# CSS in Depth

 **Update**: *I'm excited to announce that I have signed with Manning Publications. “Taming CSS” is now “CSS in Depth”. I am keeping the early drafts of these first chapters here for now, but be aware that these are rough; they have come a long way since. The book is available for sale as a <abbr title="Manning Early Access Program">MEAP</abbr> at <a href="https://manning.com/books/css-in-depth">manning.com</a>*

 *This does mean that further updates to the manuscript will not be available here on GitHub. For that, I am sorry. But after consideration, I have decided that working with the publisher will help me to produce a much higher-quality book in the end, and hopefully enable the book to reach a larger audience.*

 This is a book taking a comprehensive look at how to write and maintain CSS.  It is written primarily for web developers, but I start with the basics so anybody should be able to pick up and follow along. For more on why I am writing it and what sets it apart from other CSS books out there, I invite you to read the [Introduction](introduction.md).

## Initial drafts
These are not the newest versions of these chapters; these are **very rough** drafts as I've had them here on GitHub. Note the chapter numbers don't align with the current Table of Contents.
